{"task_id": 33, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\n\n\ndef sort_third(l: list):\n    \"\"\"This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that\n    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal\n    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.\n    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])\n    [1, 2, 3]\n    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])\n    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a list to hold the values at the indicies that are not divisible by three\n    l_not_divisible_by_three = []\n    # Create a list to hold the values at the indicies that are divisible by three\n    l_divisible_by_three = []\n\n    # Loop through l and sort the values at the indicies that are not divisible by three\n    for i in range(len(l)):\n        if i % 3 != 0:\n            l_not_divisible_by_three.append(l[i])\n        else:\n            l_divisible_by_three.append(l[i])\n    l_not_divisible_by_three.sort()\n\n    # Combine the two lists\n    l_sorted = l_not_divisible_by_three + l_divisible_by_three\n\n    return l_sorted\n\n\n\ndef sort_third_inplace(l: list):\n    \"\"\"This function takes a list l and sorts the values at the indicies that are not divisible by three,\n    while leaving the values at the indicies that are divisible by three in their original order.\n    >>> sort_third_inplace([1, 2, 3])\n    [1, 2, 3]\n    >>> sort_third_inplace([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])\n    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9]\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a list to hold the values at the indicies that are not divisible by three\n    l_not_divisible_by_three = []\n    # Create a list to hold the values at the indicies that are divisible by three\n    l_divisible_by_three = []\n\n    # Loop through l and sort the values at the indicies that are not divisible by three\n    for i in range(len(l)):\n        if i % 3 != 0:\n            l_not_divisible_by_three.append(l[i])\n        else:\n            l_divisible_by_three.append(l[i])"}
