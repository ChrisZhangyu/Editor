{"task_id": 143, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\n\ndef words_in_sentence(sentence):\n    \"\"\"\n    You are given a string representing a sentence,\n    the sentence contains some words separated by a space,\n    and you have to return a string that contains the words from the original sentence,\n    whose lengths are prime numbers,\n    the order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.\n\n    Example 1:\n        Input: sentence = \"This is a test\"\n        Output: \"is\"\n\n    Example 2:\n        Input: sentence = \"lets go for swimming\"\n        Output: \"go for\"\n\n    Constraints:\n        * 1 <= len(sentence) <= 100\n        * sentence contains only letters\n    \"\"\"\n    # define the prime numbers\n    prime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 111, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]\n\n    # split the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n    # filter the words that are not prime numbers\n    prime_words = [word for word in words if len(word) in prime_numbers]\n    # return the filtered words as a single string\n    return \" \".join(prime_words)\n\n\ndef count_vowels():\n    \"\"\"\n    Count the number of vowels in a given string.\n    Vowels are the letters a, e, i, o, u, y, and the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\n    Constraints:\n        * 1 <= len(string) <= 10000\n        * string contains only lowercase letters and digits\n    \"\"\"\n    vowels = [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\", \"y\", \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\"]\n    count = 0\n    for letter in string:\n        if letter in vowels:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef count_vowels_regex():\n    \"\"\"\n    Count the number of vowels in a given string.\n    Vowels are the letters a, e, i, o, u, y, and the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\n    Constraints:\n        * 1 <= len(string) <= 10000\n        * string contains only lowercase letters and digits\n    \"\"\"\n    import re\n    vowels = [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\", \"y\","}
