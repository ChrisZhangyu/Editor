{"task_id": 68, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\n\ndef pluck(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    \"Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes\n    your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.\n    The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.\n    If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found return the node that has smallest index.\n\n    The plucked node should be returned in a list, [ smalest_value, its index ],\n    If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].\n\n    Example 1:\n        Input: [4,2,3]\n        Output: [2, 1]\n        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.\n\n    Example 2:\n        Input: [1,2,3]\n        Output: [2, 1]\n        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index. \n\n    Example 3:\n        Input: []\n        Output: []\n    \n    Example 4:\n        Input: [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]\n        Output: [0, 1]\n        Explanation: 0 is the smallest value, but  there are two zeros,\n                     so we will choose the first zero, which has the smallest index.\n\n    Constraints:\n        * 1 <= nodes.length <= 10000\n        * 0 <= node.value\n    \"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    result = []\n    for i, num in enumerate(arr):\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            result.append([num, i])\n    if result:\n        return min(result)\n    else:\n        return []\n\n\n\ndef pluck_min_even_index():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function plucks the smallest even number from the array and returns its index.\n    If there are no even numbers in the array, it returns None.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    pass\n\n\n\ndef find_min_even_index():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the index of the smallest even number in the array.\n    If there are no even numbers in the array, it returns None.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    pass\n\n\n\ndef find_min_even_value():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the smallest even number in the array.\n    If there are no even numbers in the array, it returns None.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    pass\n\n\n\ndef pluck_min_even_value():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function plucks the smallest even number from the array and returns its value.\n    If there are no even numbers in the array, it returns None.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    pass\n\n\n\ndef pluck_min_value():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function plucks the smallest number from the array and returns its value.\n    If the array is empty, it returns None.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    pass\n\n\n\ndef find_min_value():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the smallest number in the array.\n    If the array is empty, it returns None.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    pass\n\n\n\ndef find_min_index():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the index of the smallest number in the array.\n    If the array is empty, it returns None.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    pass\n\n\n\ndef pluck_min_index():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function plucks the smallest number from the array and returns its index.\n    If the array is empty, it returns None."}
