{"task_id": 112, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\n\ndef reverse_delete(s,c):\n    \"\"\"Task\n    We are given two strings s and c, you have to deleted all the characters in s that are equal to any character in c\n    then check if the result string is palindrome.\n    A string is called palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.\n    You should return a tuple containing the result string and True/False for the check.\n    Example\n    For s = \"abcde\", c = \"ae\", the result should be ('bcd',False)\n    For s = \"abcdef\", c = \"b\"  the result should be ('acdef',False)\n    For s = \"abcdedcba\", c = \"ab\", the result should be ('cdedc',True)\n    \"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    result = \"\"\n    for i in s:\n        if i not in c:\n            result += i\n    return result, result == result[::-1]\n\n\ndef reverse_delete_inplace(s,c):\n    \"\"\"Task\n    We are given two strings s and c, you have to deleted all the characters in s that are equal to any character in c\n    then check if the result string is palindrome.\n    A string is called palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.\n    You should return a tuple containing the result string and True/False for the check.\n    Example\n    For s = \"abcde\", c = \"ae\", the result should be ('bcd',False)\n    For s = \"abcdef\", c = \"b\"  the result should be ('acdef',False)\n    For s = \"abcdedcba\", c = \"ab\", the result should be ('cdedc',True)\n    \"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    for i in c:\n        s = s.replace(i,\"\")\n    return s, s == s[::-1]\n\n\ndef reverse_delete_list(s,c):\n    \"\"\"Task\n    We are given two strings s and c, you have to deleted all the characters in s that are equal to any character in c\n    then check if the result string is palindrome.\n    A string is called palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.\n    You should return a tuple containing the result string and True/False for the check.\n    Example\n    For s = \"abcde\", c = \"ae\", the result should be ('bcd',False)\n    For s = \"abcdef\", c = \"b\"  the result should be ('acdef',False)\n    For s = \"abcdedcba\", c = \"ab\", the result should be ('cdedc',True)\n    \"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    result = list(s)\n    for i in c:\n        result.remove(i)\n    result = \"\".join(result)\n    return result, result == result[::-1]\n\n\ndef reverse_delete_pythonic(s,c):\n    \"\"\"Task"}
