{"task_id": 80, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\n\ndef is_happy(s):\n    \"\"\"You are given a string s.\n    Your task is to check if the string is happy or not.\n    A string is happy if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct\n    For example:\n    is_happy(a) => False\n    is_happy(aa) => False\n    is_happy(abcd) => True\n    is_happy(aabb) => False\n    is_happy(adb) => True\n    is_happy(xyy) => False\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(s) < 3:\n        return False\n    else:\n        for i in range(len(s)-2):\n            if s[i] == s[i+1] and s[i+1] == s[i+2]:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n\ndef is_happy_optimized(s):\n    \"\"\"You are given a string s.\n    Your task is to check if the string is happy or not.\n    A string is happy if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct\n    For example:\n    is_happy(a) => False\n    is_happy(aa) => False\n    is_happy(abcd) => True\n    is_happy(aabb) => False\n    is_happy(adb) => True\n    is_happy(xyy) => False\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(s) < 3:\n        return False\n    else:\n        return len(set(s[i:i+3] for i in range(len(s)-2)) == len(s[i:i+3) for i in range(len(s)-2))\n\n\ndef is_happy_regex(s):\n    \"\"\"You are given a string s.\n    Your task is to check if the string is happy or not.\n    A string is happy if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct\n    For example:\n    is_happy(a) => False\n    is_happy(aa) => False\n    is_happy(abcd) => True\n    is_happy(aabb) => False\n    is_happy(adb) => True\n    is_happy(xyy) => False\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(s) < 3:\n        return False\n    else:\n        return not re.search(r'([a-zA-Z])\\1\\1', s)\n\n\ndef is_happy_numpy(s):\n    \"\"\"You are given a string s.\n    Your task is to check if the string is happy or not.\n    A string is happy if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters"}
