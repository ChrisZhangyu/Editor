{"task_id": 63, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\n\n\ndef fibfib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"The FibFib number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequnece that's defined as follows:\n    fibfib(0) == 0\n    fibfib(1) == 0\n    fibfib(2) == 1\n    fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3).\n    Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence.\n    >>> fibfib(1)\n    0\n    >>> fibfib(5)\n    4\n    >>> fibfib(8)\n    24\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 2:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3)\n\n\n\ndef fibfib_efficient(n: int):\n    \"\"\"The FibFib number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequnece that's defined as follows:\n    fibfib(0) == 0\n    fibfib(1) == 0\n    fibfib(2) == 1\n    fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3).\n    Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence.\n    >>> fibfib(1)\n    0\n    >>> fibfib(5)\n    4\n    >>> fibfib(8)\n    24\n    \"\"\"\n    a, b, c = 0, 0, 1\n    for _ in range(n-2):\n        a, b, c = b, c, a + b + c\n    return c\n\n\n\ndef fibonacci_efficient(n: int):\n    \"\"\"The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:\n    fibonacci(0) == 0\n    fibonacci(1) == 1\n    fibonacci(n) == fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2).\n    Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence.\n    >>> fibonacci(1)\n    1\n    >>> fibonacci(5)\n    5\n    >>> fibonacci(8)\n    21\n    \"\"\"\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for _ in range(n-1):\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    return a\n\n\n\ndef fibonacci_naive(n: int):\n    \"\"\"The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:\n    fibonacci(0) == 0\n"}
