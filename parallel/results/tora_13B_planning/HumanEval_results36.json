{"task_id": 36, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\n\n\ndef fizz_buzz(n: int):\n    \"\"\"Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.\n    >>> fizz_buzz(50)\n    0\n    >>> fizz_buzz(78)\n    2\n    >>> fizz_buzz(79)\n    3\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if i % 13 == 0 or i % 1 == 0:\n            count += str(i).count('7')\n    return count\n\n\n\ndef count_vowels():\n    \"\"\"Count the number of vowels in a string.\n    >>> count_vowels(\"hi\")\n    1\n    >>> count_vowels(\"hi there\")\n    3\n    \"\"\"\n    vowels = \"aeiou\"\n    count = 0\n    for letter in vowels:\n        count += \"hi there\".count(letter)\n    return count\n\n\n\ndef count_vowels_regex():\n    \"\"\"Count the number of vowels in a string.\n    >>> count_vowels_regex(\"hi\")\n    1\n    >>> count_vowels_regex(\"hi there\")\n    3\n    \"\"\"\n    import re\n    vowels = \"aeiou\"\n    return len(re.findall(\"|\".join(vowels), \"hi there\")\n\n\n\ndef count_vowels_in_word():\n    \"\"\"Count the number of vowels in a string.\n    >>> count_vowels_in_word(\"hi\")\n    1\n    >>> count_vowels_in_word(\"hi there\")\n    3\n    \"\"\"\n    vowels = \"aeiou\"\n    count = 0\n    for letter in \"hi there\":\n        if letter in vowels:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\n\n\ndef count_vowels_in_word_pythonic():\n    \"\"\"Count the number of vowels in a string.\n    >>> count_vowels_in_word_pythonic(\"hi\")\n    1\n    >>> count_vowels_in_word_pythonic(\"hi there\")\n    3\n    \"\"\"\n    vowels = \"aeiou\"\n    return sum(1 for letter in \"hi there\" if letter in vowels)\n\n\n\ndef count_vowels_in_word_pythonic_one_line():\n    \"\"\"Count the number of vowels in a string.\n   "}
