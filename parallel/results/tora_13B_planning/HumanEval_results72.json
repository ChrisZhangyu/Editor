{"task_id": 72, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\n\ndef will_it_fly(q,w):\n    '''\n    Write a function that returns True if the object q will fly, and False otherwise.\n    The object q will fly if it's balanced (it is a palindromic list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight w.\n\n    Example:\n    will_it_fly([1, 2], 5) \u279e False \n    # 1+2 is less than the maximum possible weight, but it's unbalanced.\n\n    will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1) \u279e False\n    # it's balanced, but 3+2+3 is more than the maximum possible weight.\n\n    will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9) \u279e True\n    # 3+2+3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.\n\n    will_it_fly([3], 5) \u279e True\n    # 3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.\n    '''\n\ndef is_balanced(q):\n    '''\n    Check if a list is balanced.\n    '''\n    return q == q[::-1]\n\ndef total_weight(q):\n    '''\n    Calculate the total weight of a list.\n    '''\n    return sum(q)\n\ndef will_it_fly(q,w):\n    '''\n    Write a function that returns True if the object q will fly, and False otherwise.\n    The object q will fly if it's balanced (it is a palindromic list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight w.\n    '''\n    return is_balanced(q) and total_weight(q) <= w\n\n\ndef fly_or_not():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function will call the will_it_fly function and return the correct message based on the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    q = [1, 2]\n    w = 5\n    if will_it_fly(q, w):\n        return \"It will fly!\"\n    else:\n        return \"It won't fly.\"\n\nprint(fly_or_not())\n\ndef fly_or_not():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function will call the will_it_fly function and return the correct message based on the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    q = [3, 2, 3]\n    w = 1\n    if will_it_fly(q, w):\n        return \"It will fly!\"\n    else:\n        return \"It won't fly.\"\n\nprint(fly_or_not())\n\ndef fly_or_not():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function will call the will_it_fly function and return the correct message based on the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    q = [3, 2, 3]\n    w = 9\n    if will_it_fly(q, w):\n        return \"It will fly!\"\n    else:\n        return \"It won't fly.\"\n\nprint(fly_or_not())\n\ndef fly_or_not():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function will call the will_it_fly function and return the correct message based on the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    q ="}
