{"task_id": 79, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\n\ndef decimal_to_binary(decimal):\n    \"\"\"You will be given a number in decimal form and your task is to convert it to\n    binary format. The function should return a string, with each character representing a binary\n    number. Each character in the string will be '0' or '1'.\n\n    There will be an extra couple of characters 'db' at the beginning and at the end of the string.\n    The extra characters are there to help with the format.\n\n    Examples:\n    decimal_to_binary(15)   # returns \"db1111db\"\n    decimal_to_binary(32)   # returns \"db100000db\"\n    \"\"\"\n    binary = format(decimal, \"b\")\n    return \"db\" + binary + \"db\"\n\n\ndef binary_to_decimal(binary):\n    \"\"\"You will be given a binary number in string form and your task is to convert it to\n    decimal format. The function should return an integer.\n\n    The binary number will be in the form of \"db10101db\", where \"db\" are extra characters\n    used to help with the format.\n\n    Examples:\n    binary_to_decimal(\"db111db\")   # returns 15\n    binary_to_decimal(\"db10000db\")   # returns 32\n    \"\"\"\n    binary = binary[2:-2]\n    return int(binary, 2)\n\ndef binary_addition():\n    \"\"\"You will be given two binary numbers as strings. Your task is to add them and return the result\n    in binary format.\n\n    The binary numbers will be in the form of \"db10101db\", where \"db\" are extra characters\n    used to help with the format.\n\n    Examples:\n    binary_addition(\"db1010db\", \"db11001db\")   # returns \"db1100000db\"\n    binary_addition(\"db1111100db\", \"db10000db\")   # returns \"db11100000db\"\n    \"\"\"\n    binary1 = \"1\" + binary_to_decimal(\"db10101db\")\n    binary2 = \"1\" + binary_to_decimal(\"db10000db\")\n    result = binary1 + binary2\n    return decimal_to_binary(result)\n\ndef binary_subtraction():\n    \"\"\"You will be given two binary numbers as strings. Your task is to subtract the second number from\n    the first and return the result in binary format.\n\n    The binary numbers will be in the form of \"db10101db\", where \"db\" are extra characters\n    used to help with the format.\n\n    Examples:\n    binary_subtraction(\"db1010db\", \"db1"}
