{"task_id": 26, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\nfrom typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    result = [num for num in numbers if num not in seen and not seen.add(num)]\n    return result\n\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates_with_set(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\"\n    result = [num for num in set(numbers)]\n    return result\n\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates_with_dict(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\"\n    result = []\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num not in result:\n            result.append(num)\n    return result\n\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates_with_collections(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\"\n    from collections import OrderedDict\n    result = list(OrderedDict.fromkeys(numbers))\n    return result\n\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates_with_more_collections(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\"\n    from collections import deque\n    result = list(deque(set(numbers)))\n    return result\n\n\n\ndef remove"}
