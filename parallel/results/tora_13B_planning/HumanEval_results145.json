{"task_id": 145, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\n\ndef order_by_points(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function which sorts the given list of integers\n    in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.\n    Note: if there are several items with similar sum of their digits,\n    order them based on their index in original list.\n\n    For example:\n    >>> order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]\n    >>> order_by_points([]) == []\n    \"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    # Create a list to store the numbers and their sum of digits\n    num_sum = []\n    for i in nums:\n        num_sum.append((i, sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i)))\n    # Sort the list by the sum of digits\n    num_sum.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n    # Return the sorted list of numbers\n    return [num[0] for num in num_sum]\n\n\n\ndef order_by_points(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function which sorts the given list of integers\n    in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.\n    Note: if there are several items with similar sum of their digits,\n    order them based on their index in original list.\n\n    For example:\n    >>> order_by_points([1, 1, -1, -1, -12]) == [-1, -1, 1, -12, 1]\n    >>> order_by_points([]) == []\n    \"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    # Create a list to store the numbers and their sum of digits\n    num_sum = []\n    for i in nums:\n        num_sum.append((i, sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i)))\n    # Sort the list by the sum of digits\n    num_sum.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n    # Return the sorted list of numbers\n    return [num[0] for num in num_sum]\n\n\n\ndef order_by_points(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function which sorts the given list of integers\n    in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.\n    Note: if there are several items with similar sum of their digits,\n    order them based on their index in original list.\n\n    For example:\n    >>> order_by_points([1, 1, -1, -1, -12]) == [-1, -1, 1, -12, 1]\n    >>> order_by_points([]) == []\n    \"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    # Create a list to store the numbers and their sum of digits\n    num_"}
