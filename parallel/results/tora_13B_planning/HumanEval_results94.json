{"task_id": 94, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\n\n\ndef skjkasdkd(lst):\n    \"\"\"You are given a list of integers.\n    You need to find the largest prime value and return the sum of its digits.\n\n    Examples:\n    For lst = [0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3] the output should be 10\n    For lst = [1,0,1,8,2,4597,2,1,3,40,1,2,1,2,4,2,5,1] the output should be 25\n    For lst = [1,3,1,32,5107,34,83278,109,163,23,2323,32,30,1,9,3] the output should be 13\n    For lst = [0,724,32,71,99,32,6,0,5,91,83,0,5,6] the output should be 11\n    For lst = [0,81,12,3,1,21] the output should be 3\n    For lst = [0,8,1,2,1,7] the output should be 7\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a list of prime numbers less than 10000\n    prime_list = [i for i in range(1, 10000) if all([i%j != 0 for j in range(2, i)])]\n\n    # Get the largest prime number from the list that is less than the maximum number in the input list\n    prime = max(prime_list)\n\n    # Return the sum of the digits of the prime number\n    return sum(map(int, str(prime))\n\n\n\ndef sum_of_digits():\n    \"\"\"You are given a list of integers.\n    You need to find the largest prime value and return the sum of its digits.\n\n    Examples:\n    For lst = [0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3] the output should be 10\n    For lst = [1,0,1,8,2,4597,2,1,3,40,1,2,1,2,4,2,5,1] the output should be 25\n    For lst = [1,3,1,32,5107,34,83278,109,163,23,2323,32,30,1,9,3] the output should be 13\n    For lst = [0,724,32,71,99,32,6,0,5,91,83,0,5,6] the output should be 11\n    For lst = [0,81,12,3,1,21] the output should be 3\n    For lst = [0,8,1,2,1,7] the output should be 7\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a list of prime numbers less than 10000\n    prime_list = [i for i in range(1, 10000) if all([i%j != 0 for j in range(2, i)])]\n\n    #"}
