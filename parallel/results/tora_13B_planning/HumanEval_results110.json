{"task_id": 110, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\n\ndef exchange(lst1, lst2):\n    \"\"\"In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers,\n    and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements\n    between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.\n    There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.\n    If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make\n    all the elements of lst1 to be even, return \"YES\".\n    Otherwise, return \"NO\".\n    For example:\n    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => \"YES\"\n    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => \"NO\"\n    It is assumed that the input lists will be non-empty.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize a counter for the number of odd numbers in lst1\n    odd_count = 0\n\n    # Iterate over lst1 and count the number of odd numbers\n    for num in lst1:\n        if num % 2 != 0:\n            odd_count += 1\n\n    # If there are no odd numbers in lst1, return \"YES\"\n    if odd_count == 0:\n        return \"YES\"\n\n    # Iterate over lst2 and try to find an odd number\n    for num in lst2:\n        if num % 2 != 0:\n            # If an odd number is found, exchange it with an even number from lst1 and\n            # return \"YES\" if the resulting list is still a list of only even numbers\n            for i in range(len(lst1)):\n                if lst1[i] % 2 == 0:\n                    lst1[i], lst2[lst2.index(num)] = num, lst1[i]\n                    if all(num % 2 == 0 for num in lst1):\n                        return \"YES\"\n                    # If the exchange resulted in an even list, break the loop\n                    break\n\n    # If no odd number is found in lst2 or no exchange results in an even list, return \"NO\"\n    return \"NO\"\n\n\n\ndef exchange_inplace(lst1, lst2):\n    \"\"\"In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers,\n    and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements\n    between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.\n    There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.\n    If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make\n    all the elements of lst1 to be even, return \"YES\".\n    Otherwise, return \"NO\".\n    For example:\n    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => \"YES\"\n    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => \"NO\"\n    It is assumed that the input lists will be non-empty"}
