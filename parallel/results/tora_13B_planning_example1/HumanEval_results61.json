{"task_id": 61, "completion": "<s> \ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\n\n\ndef correct_bracketing(brackets: str):\n    \"\"\" brackets is a string of \"(\" and \")\".\n    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.\n\n    >>> correct_bracketing(\"(\")\n    False\n    >>> correct_bracketing(\"()\")\n    True\n    >>> correct_bracketing(\"(()())\")\n    True\n    >>> correct_bracketing(\")(()\")\n    False\n    \"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    return True\n\n\n\ndef count_vowels():\n    \"\"\"Count the number of vowels in a string\"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    return 0\n\n\n\ndef count_consonants():\n    \"\"\"Count the number of consonants in a string\"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    return 0\n\n\n\ndef count_punctuation():\n    \"\"\"Count the number of punctuation marks in a string\"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    return 0\n\n\n\ndef count_words():\n    \"\"\"Count the number of words in a string\"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    return 0\n\n\n\ndef count_syllables():\n    \"\"\"Count the number of syllables in a string\"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    return 0\n\n\n\ndef count_sentences():\n    \"\"\"Count the number of sentences in a string\"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    return 0\n\n\n\ndef count_characters():\n    \"\"\"Count the number of characters in a string\"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    return 0\n\n\n\ndef count_symbols():\n    \"\"\"Count the number of symbols in a string\"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    return 0\n\n\n\ndef count_numbers():\n    \"\"\"Count the number of numbers in a string\"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    return 0\n\n\n\ndef count_spaces():\n    \"\"\"Count the number of spaces in a string\"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    return 0\n\n\n\ndef count_lines():\n    \"\"\"Count the number of lines in a string\"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    return 0\n\n\n\ndef count_tokens():\n    \"\"\"Count the number of tokens in a string\"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    return 0\n\n\n\ndef count_types():\n    \"\"\"Count the number of types in a string\"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    return 0\n\n\n\ndef count_all():\n    \"\"\"Count all the above in a string\"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    return 0\n</s>"}
