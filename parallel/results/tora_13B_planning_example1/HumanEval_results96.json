{"task_id": 96, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\n\ndef count_up_to(n):\n    \"\"\"Implement a function that takes an non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n\n    integers that are prime numbers and less than n.\n    for example:\n    count_up_to(5) => [2,3]\n    count_up_to(11) => [2,3,5,7]\n    count_up_to(0) => []\n    count_up_to(20) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19]\n    count_up_to(1) => []\n    count_up_to(18) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17]\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize a list to store the prime numbers\n    prime_numbers = []\n\n    # Loop through the numbers from 2 to n\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        # Check if the number is prime\n        if is_prime(i):\n            prime_numbers.append(i)\n\n    return prime_numbers\n\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"Implement a function that checks if a number is prime.\"\"\"\n    # Loop through the numbers from 2 to n-1\n    for i in range(2, n):\n        # If the number is divisible by the current number, it is not prime\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    # If no number divisible by i was found, the number is prime\n    return True\n\n\ndef count_up_to_optimized(n):\n    \"\"\"Implement a function that takes an non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n\n    integers that are prime numbers and less than n.\n    for example:\n    count_up_to(5) => [2,3]\n    count_up_to(1) => [2,3,5,7]\n    count_up_to(0) => []\n    count_up_to(20) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19]\n    count_up_to(1) => []\n    count_up_to(18) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17]\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize a list to store the prime numbers\n    prime_numbers = []\n\n    # Loop through the numbers from 2 to n\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        # If the number is prime, add it to the list\n        if is_prime_optimized(i):\n            prime_numbers.append(i)\n\n    return prime_numbers\n\ndef is_prime_optimized(n):\n    \"\"\"Implement a function that checks if a number is prime.\"\"\"\n    # Loop through the numbers from 2 to n-1\n    for i in range(2, n):\n        # If the number is divis"}
