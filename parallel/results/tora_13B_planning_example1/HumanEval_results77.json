{"task_id": 77, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\n\ndef iscube(a):\n    '''\n    Write a function that takes an integer a and returns True \n    if this ingeger is a cube of some integer number.\n    Note: you may assume the input is always valid.\n    Examples:\n    iscube(1) ==> True\n    iscube(2) ==> False\n    iscube(-1) ==> True\n    iscube(64) ==> True\n    iscube(0) ==> True\n    iscube(180) ==> False\n    '''\n\ndef iscube(a):\n    \"\"\"Write a function that takes an integer a and returns True \n    if this ingeger is a cube of some integer number.\n    Note: you may assume the input is always valid.\"\"\"\n    # The cube root of a is equal to a**(1/3), so we can check if a is a cube by seeing if a**(1/3) is an integer\n    return a**(1/3) == int(a**(1/3) and a > 0)\n\n\ndef iscube_improved(a):\n    \"\"\"Write a function that takes an integer a and returns True \n    if this ingeger is a cube of some integer number.\n    Note: you may assume the input is always valid.\"\"\"\n    # The cube root of a is equal to a**(1/3), so we can check if a is a cube by seeing if a**(1/3) is an integer\n    return a**(1/3) == int(a**(1/3)\n\ndef iscube_bruteforce(a):\n    \"\"\"Write a function that takes an integer a and returns True \n    if this ingeger is a cube of some integer number.\n    Note: you may assume the input is always valid.\"\"\"\n    # A number a is a cube of some integer if it can be written as k^3 for some integer k\n    k = a**(1/3)\n    return k == int(k)\n\n\ndef iscube_bruteforce_improved(a):\n    \"\"\"Write a function that takes an integer a and returns True \n    if this ingeger is a cube of some integer number.\n    Note: you may assume the input is always valid.\"\"\"\n    # A number a is a cube of some integer if it can be written as k^3 for some integer k\n    k = a**(1/3)\n    return k == int(k)\n\n\ndef iscube_bruteforce_improved_2(a):\n    \"\"\"Write a function that takes an integer a and returns True \n    if this ingeger is a cube of some integer number.\n    Note: you may assume the input is always valid.\"\"\"\n    #"}
