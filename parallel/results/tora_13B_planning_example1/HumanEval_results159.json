{"task_id": 159, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\n\ndef eat(number, need, remaining):\n    \"\"\"\n    You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of carrots,\n    but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.\n    you should return an array of [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals,\n                                    the number of carrots left after your meals ]\n    if there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.\n    \n    Example:\n    * eat(5, 6, 10) -> [11, 4]\n    * eat(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 1]\n    * eat(1, 10, 10) -> [11, 0]\n    * eat(2, 11, 5) -> [7, 0]\n    \n    Variables:\n    @number : integer\n        the number of carrots that you have eaten.\n    @need : integer\n        the number of carrots that you need to eat.\n    @remaining : integer\n        the number of remaining carrots thet exist in stock\n    \n    Constrain:\n    * 0 <= number <= 1000\n    * 0 <= need <= 1000\n    * 0 <= remaining <= 1000\n\n    Have fun :)\n    \"\"\"\n    total_carrots = number + need\n    remaining_carrots = remaining - need\n    if total_carrots > 100:\n        remaining_carrots = total_carrots - 10\n        total_carrots = 10\n    return [total_carrots, remaining_carrots]\n\n\ndef eat_all(number, need, remaining):\n    \"\"\"\n    You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of carrots,\n    but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.\n    you should return an array of [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals,\n                                    the number of carrots left after your meals ]\n    if there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.\n    \n    Example:\n    * eat_all(5, 6, 10) -> [111, 0]\n    * eat_all(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 0]\n    * eat_all(1, 10, 10) -> [11, 0]\n    * eat_all(2, 11, 5) -> [7, 0]\n    \n    Variables:\n    @number : integer\n        the number of carrots that you have eaten.\n    @need : integer\n        the number of carrots that you need to eat.\n    @remaining : integer\n        the number of remaining carrots thet exist in stock\n    \n    Constrain:\n    * 0 <= number <= 1000\n    * 0 <= need <= 1000\n    * 0 <= remaining <= 1000\n\n    Have fun :)\n    \"\"\"\n    total_carrots = number + need\n    remaining_carrots = remaining - need\n    if total_carrots > 10:\n        remaining_carrots = 0\n        total_carrots = 10\n    return [total_carrots, remaining_carrots]\n\ndef eat_all"}
