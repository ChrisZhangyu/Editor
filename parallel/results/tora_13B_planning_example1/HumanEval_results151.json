{"task_id": 151, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3.
