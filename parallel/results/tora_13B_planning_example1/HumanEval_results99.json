{"task_id": 99, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\n\ndef closest_integer(value):\n    '''\n    Create a function that takes a value (string) representing a number\n    and returns the closest integer to it. If the number is equidistant\n    from two integers, round it away from zero.\n\n    Examples\n    >>> closest_integer(\"10\")\n    10\n    >>> closest_integer(\"15.3\")\n    15\n\n    Note:\n    Rounding away from zero means that if the given number is equidistant\n    from two integers, the one you should return is the one that is the\n    farthest from zero. For example closest_integer(\"14.5\") should\n    return 15 and closest_integer(\"-14.5\") should return -15.\n    '''\n\ndef closest_integer_modified(value):\n    '''\n    Create a function that takes a value (string) representing a number\n    and returns the closest integer to it.
