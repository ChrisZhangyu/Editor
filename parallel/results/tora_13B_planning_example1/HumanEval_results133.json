{"task_id": 133, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\n\n\ndef sum_squares(lst):\n    \"\"\"You are given a list of numbers.\n    You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,\n    round each element in the list to the upper int(Ceiling) first.\n    Examples:\n    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 14\n    For lst = [1,4,9] the output should be 98\n    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 84\n    For lst = [1.4,4.2,0] the output should be 29\n    For lst = [-2.4,1,1] the output should be 6\n    \n\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum([int(i**2) for i in lst])\n\n\n\ndef sum_of_squares():\n    \"\"\"You are given a list of numbers.\n    You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,\n    round each element in the list to the upper int(Ceiling) first.\n    Examples:\n    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 14\n    For lst = [1,4,9] the output should be 98\n    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 84\n    For lst = [1.4,4.2,0] the output should be 29\n    For lst = [-2.4,1,1] the output should be 6\n    \n    \"\"\"\n    lst = [1,2,3]\n    return sum([int(i**2) for i in lst])\n\n\n\ndef sum_of_squares_2():\n    \"\"\"You are given a list of numbers.\n    You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,\n    round each element in the list to the upper int(Ceiling) first.\n    Examples:\n    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 14\n    For lst = [1,4,9] the output should be 98\n    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 84\n    For lst = [1.4,4.2,0] the output should be 29\n    For lst = [-2.4,1,1] the output should be 6\n    \n    \"\"\"\n    lst = [1.4,4.2,0]\n    return sum([int(i**2) for i in lst])\n\n\n\ndef sum_of_squares_3():\n    \"\"\"You are given a list of numbers.\n    You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,\n    round each element in the list to the upper int(Ceiling) first.\n    Examples:\n    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 14\n    For lst = [1,4,"}
