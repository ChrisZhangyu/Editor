{"task_id": 149, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\n\ndef sorted_list_sum(lst):\n    \"\"\"Write a function that accepts a list of strings as a parameter,\n    deletes the strings that have odd lengths from it,\n    and returns the resulted list with a sorted order,\n    The list is always a list of strings and never an array of numbers,\n    and it may contain duplicates.\n    The order of the list should be ascending by length of each word, and you\n    should return the list sorted by that rule.\n    If two words have the same length, sort the list alphabetically.\n    The function should return a list of strings in sorted order.\n    You may assume that all words will have the same length.\n    For example:\n    assert list_sort([\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"]) => [\"aa\"]\n    assert list_sort([\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]) => [\"ab\", \"cd\"]\n    \"\"\"\n    # Filter out the strings with odd lengths\n    lst = [string for string in lst if len(string) % 2 == 0]\n    # Sort the list by length and then alphabetically\n    lst.sort(key=lambda x: (len(x), x) )\n    return lst\n\n\ndef list_sort(lst):\n    \"\"\"Write a function that accepts a list of strings as a parameter,\n    deletes the strings that have odd lengths from it,\n    and returns the resulted list with a sorted order,\n    The list is always a list of strings and never an array of numbers,\n    and it may contain duplicates.\n    The order of the list should be ascending by length of each word, and you\n    should return the list sorted by that rule.\n    If two words have the same length, sort the list alphabetically.\n    The function should return a list of strings in sorted order.\n    You may assume that all words will have the same length.\n    For example:\n    assert list_sort([\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"]) => [\"aa\"]\n    assert list_sort([\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]) => [\"ab\", \"cd\"]\n    \"\"\"\n    # Filter out the strings with odd lengths\n    lst = [string for string in lst if len(string) % 2 == 0]\n    # Sort the list by length and then alphabetically\n    lst.sort(key=lambda x: (len(x), x) )\n    return lst\n\n\ndef sum_of_strings():\n    \"\"\"Write a function that takes a list of strings as an argument and returns the sum of all the strings.\n    The function should return a string.\n    For example:\n    assert sum_of_strings([\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"]) => \"aaa\"\n    assert sum_of_strings([\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]) => \"aaaaab\"\n    \"\"\"\n    return \"\".join(lst)\n\n\ndef sum_of_strings():\n    \"\"\"Write a function that takes a list of strings as an argument and returns the sum of all the strings.\n    The function should return a string.\n    For example:\n    assert sum_of_strings([\"aa\", \"a"}
