{"task_id": 4, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\nfrom typing import List\n\n\ndef mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:\n    \"\"\" For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation\n    around the mean of this dataset.\n    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each\n    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):\n    MAD = average | x - x_mean |\n    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])\n    1.0\n    \"\"\"\n    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n    absolute_differences = [abs(x - mean) for x in numbers]\n    mean_absolute_deviation = sum(absolute_differences) / len(numbers)\n    return mean_absolute_deviation\n\n\n\ndef test_mean_absolute_deviation():\n    \"\"\"Test the mean_absolute_deviation function.\"\"\"\n    # Test with a list of integers\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n    mad = mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)\n    assert mad == 1.0\n\n    # Test with a list of floats\n    numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]\n    mad = mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)\n    assert mad == 1.0\n\n\n\ntest_mean_absolute_deviation()\n\n\n\ndef mean_absolute_deviation_improved(numbers: List[float]) -> float:\n    \"\"\"For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation\n    around the mean of this dataset.\n    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each\n    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):\n    MAD = average | x - x_mean |\n    This implementation is improved by not requiring the numbers to be sorted.\n    \"\"\"\n    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n    absolute_differences = [abs(x - mean) for x in numbers]\n    mean_absolute_deviation = sum(absolute_differences) / len(numbers)\n    return mean_absolute_deviation\n\n\n\ndef test_mean_absolute_deviation_improved():\n    \"\"\"Test the mean_absolute_deviation_improved function.\"\"\"\n    # Test with a list of integers\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n    mad = mean_absolute_deviation_improved(numbers)\n    assert mad == 1.0\n\n    # Test with a list of floats\n    numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]\n    mad = mean_absolute_de"}
