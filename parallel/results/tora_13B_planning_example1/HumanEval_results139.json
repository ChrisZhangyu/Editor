{"task_id": 139, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\n\ndef special_factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"The Brazilian factorial is defined as:\n    brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!\n    where n > 0\n\n    For example:\n    >>> special_factorial(4)\n    288\n\n    The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special\n    factorial of this integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        result *= i\n    return result\n\n\ndef factorial_of_sum(n, k):\n    \"\"\"The factorial of the sum of n and k is defined as:\n    factorial_of_sum(n, k) = (n+k)! / n! * k!\n\n    For example:\n    >>> factorial_of_sum(4, 3)\n    28\n\n    The function will receive two integers as input and should return the factorial of the sum of these\n    integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return special_factorial(n + k) / (special_factorial(n) * special_factorial(k))\n\n\ndef count_vowels(s):\n    \"\"\"Count the number of vowels in a string.\n\n    For example:\n    >>> count_vowels(\"hi\")\n    1\n    >>> count_vowels(\"hello\")\n    2\n\n    The function will receive a string as input and should return the number of vowels in this string.\n    \"\"\"\n    vowels = \"aeiou\"\n    return sum(s.count(vowel) for vowel in vowels)\n\ndef count_consonants(s):\n    \"\"\"Count the number of consonants in a string.\n\n    For example:\n    >>> count_consonants(\"hi\")\n    1\n    >>> count_consonants(\"hello\")\n    3\n\n    The function will receive a string as input and should return the number of consonants in this string.\n    \"\"\"\n    consonants = \"bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz\"\n    return sum(s.count(consonant) for consonant in consonants)\n\ndef count_punctuation(s):\n    \"\"\"Count the number of punctuation marks in a string.\n\n    For example:\n    >>> count_punctuation(\"hi\")\n    0\n    >>> count_punctuation(\"hello, world!\")\n    1\n\n    The function will receive a string as input and should return the number of punctuation marks in this string.\n    \"\"\"\n    pun"}
