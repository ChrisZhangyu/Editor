{"task_id": 51, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\n\n\ndef remove_vowels(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    remove_vowels is a function that takes string and returns string without vowels.\n    >>> remove_vowels('')\n    ''\n    >>> remove_vowels(\"abcdef\\nghijklm\")\n    'bcdf\\nghjklm'\n    >>> remove_vowels('abcdef')\n    'bcdf'\n    >>> remove_vowels('aaaaa')\n    ''\n    >>> remove_vowels('aaBAA')\n    'B'\n    >>> remove_vowels('zbcd')\n    'zbcd'\n    \"\"\"\n    vowels = 'aeiou'\n    result = ''\n    for letter in text:\n        if letter not in vowels:\n            result += letter\n    return result\n\n\n\ndef count_vowels(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    count_vowels is a function that takes string and returns the count of vowels.\n    >>> count_vowels('')\n    0\n    >>> count_vowels(\"abcdef\\nghijklm\")\n    3\n    >>> count_vowels('abcdef')\n    2\n    >>> count_vowels('aaaaa')\n    2\n    >>> count_vowels('aaBAA')\n    2\n    >>> count_vowels('zbcd')\n    0\n    \"\"\"\n    vowels = 'aeiou'\n    count = 0\n    for letter in text:\n        if letter in vowels:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\n\n\ndef count_vowels_in_word(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    count_vowels_in_word is a function that takes string and returns the count of vowels in a word.\n    >>> count_vowels_in_word('')\n    0\n    >>> count_vowels_in_word(\"abcdef\\nghijklm\")\n    0\n    >>> count_vowels_in_word('abcdef')\n    2\n    >>> count_vowels_in_word('aaaaa')\n    2\n    >>> count_vowels_in_word('aaBAA')\n    2\n    >>> count_vowels_in_word('zbcd')\n    0\n    \"\"\"\n    vowels = 'aeiou'\n    count = 0\n    for letter in word:\n        if letter in vowels:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\n\n\ndef count_consonants(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    count_consonants is a function that takes string and returns the count of consonants.\n    >>> count_consonants('')\n    0\n    >>> count_consonants(\"abcdef\\nghijklm\")\n    5\n    >>> count"}
