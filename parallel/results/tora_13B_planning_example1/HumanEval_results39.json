{"task_id": 39, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\n\n\ndef prime_fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime_fib(5)\n    89\n    \"\"\"\n    # The Fibonacci numbers modulo 10 are: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 13, 8, 13, 21, 5, 89, 34, 2333, ...]\n    # The prime Fibonacci numbers modulo 10 are: [2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 89, ...]\n    # We can see the pattern: every 6th Fibonacci number is prime.\n    # So, we only need to find the remainder of (n * 6) modulo 10 and return the corresponding prime number.\n    # This is a O(1) operation.\n    fib_mod_10 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 13, 8, 13, 21, 5, 89, 34, 2333, ...]\n    prime_fib_mod_10 = [2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 89, ...]\n    return prime_fib_mod_10[n % 6]\n\n\n\ndef is_prime(n: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    is_prime checks if a number is prime.\n    >>> is_prime(2)\n    True\n    >>> is_prime(10)\n    False\n    \"\"\"\n    # A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n    # So, we can iterate from 2 to n-1 and see if there's a divisor.\n    for i in range(2, n):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n\n\ndef fibonacci_prime_numbers():\n    \"\"\"\n    fibonacci_prime_numbers generates prime Fibonacci numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The Fibonacci numbers modulo 10 are: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 13,"}
