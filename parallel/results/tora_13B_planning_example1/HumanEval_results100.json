{"task_id": 100, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\n\ndef make_a_pile(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.\n    The first level has n stones.\n    The number of stones in the next level is:\n        - the next odd number if n is odd.\n        - the next even number if n is even.\n    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index\n    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).\n\n    Examples:\n    >>> make_a_pile(3)\n    [3, 5, 7]\n    \"\"\"\n    pile = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            pile.append(i * 2)\n        else:\n            pile.append(i * 2 - 1)\n    return pile\n\n\ndef sum_of_pile(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.\n    The first level has n stones.\n    The number of stones in the next level is:\n        - the next odd number if n is odd.\n        - the next even number if n is even.\n    Return the sum of stones in each level, where element at index\n    i represents the sum of stones in the level (i+1).\n\n    Examples:\n    >>> sum_of_pile(3)\n    [3, 5, 7]\n    \"\"\"\n    pile = []\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            pile.append(i * 2)\n        else:\n            pile.append(i * 2 - 1)\n        total += pile[-1]\n    return total\n\n\ndef count_stones():\n    \"\"\"\n    You have a pile of stones.\n    Each level has an increasing number of stones.\n    You can remove any number of stones from the top of the pile.\n    Your goal is to remove stones in a way that the total number of stones in the pile is divisible by 3.\n    You can't remove stones from the bottom of the pile.\n    You can't remove more stones than the number of stones in the top level.\n    Return the maximum number of stones you can remove.\n\n    Examples:\n    >>> count_stones([3, 5, 7])\n    7\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize a list to store the number of stones in each level.\n    stones = []\n\n    # Loop through the input and add each number to the list.\n    for i in range(1, 100, 2):\n        stones.append(i)\n\n    # Initialize"}
