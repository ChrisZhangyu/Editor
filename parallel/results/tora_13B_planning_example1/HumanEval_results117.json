{"task_id": 117, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\n\ndef select_words(s, n):\n    \"\"\"Given a string s and a natural number n, you have been tasked to implement \n    a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly \n    n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.\n    If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.\n    Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.\n    Examples:\n    select_words(\"Mary had a little lamb\", 4) ==> [\"little\"]\n    select_words(\"Mary had a little lamb\", 3) ==> [\"Mary\", \"lamb\"]\n    select_words(\"simple white space\", 2) ==> []\n    select_words(\"Hello world\", 4) ==> [\"world\"]\n    select_words(\"Uncle sam\", 3) ==> [\"Uncle\"]\n    \"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    result = []\n    for word in s.split():\n        if sum(1 for letter in word if letter not in 'aeiou') == n:\n            result.append(word)\n    return result\n\n\ndef count_vowels():\n    \"\"\"This function counts the number of vowels in a string.\n    Returns: the number of vowels in the string.\n    \"\"\"\n    s = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n    vowels = sum(1 for letter in s if letter in 'aeiou')\n    return vowels\n\ndef count_consonants():\n    \"\"\"This function counts the number of consonants in a string.\n    Returns: the number of consonants in the string.\n    \"\"\"\n    s = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n    consonants = sum(1 for letter in s if letter not in 'aeiou')\n    return consonants\n\ndef count_vowels_and_consonants():\n    \"\"\"This function counts the number of vowels and consonants in a string.\n    Returns: a tuple of the number of vowels and consonants in the string.\n    \"\"\"\n    s = input(\"Enter a string: \")\n    vowels = sum(1 for letter in s if letter in 'aeiou')\n    consonants = sum(1 for letter in s if letter not in 'aeiou')\n    return vowels, consonants\n\ndef count_vowels_and_consonants_in_list():\n    \"\"\"This function counts the number of vowels and consonants in a list of strings.\n    Returns: a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the number of vowels and consonants in a string.\n    \"\"\"\n    strings = [input(\"Enter a string: \") for _ in range(3)]\n    counts = [count_vowels_and_consonants() for string in strings]\n    return counts\n\ndef count_vowels_and_consonants_in_file():\n    \"\"\"This function counts the number of vowels and consonants in a file.\n    Returns: a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the number of v"}
