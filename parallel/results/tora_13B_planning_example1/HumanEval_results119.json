{"task_id": 119, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\n\ndef match_parens(lst):\n    '''\n    You are given a list of two strings, both strings consist of open\n    parentheses '(' or close parentheses ')' only.\n    Your job is to check if it is possible to concatenate the two strings in\n    some order, that the resulting string will be good.\n    A string S is considered to be good if and only if all parentheses in S\n    are balanced. For example: the string '(())()' is good, while the string\n    '())' is not.\n    Return 'Yes' if there's a way to make a good string, and return 'No' otherwise.\n\n    Examples:\n    match_parens(['()(', ')']) == 'Yes'\n    match_parens([')', ')']) == 'No'\n    '''\n\ndef count_down_from_10():\n    '''\n    Create a function that counts down from 10 to 0, and for each number, it prints the number and\n    the number of seconds left (10 to 0 in 10 seconds).\n    '''\n\ndef count_down_from_10_v2():\n    '''\n    Create a function that counts down from 10 to 0, and for each number, it prints the number and\n    the number of seconds left (10 to 0 in 10 seconds).\n    This version uses the time module.\n    '''\n\ndef count_down_from_10_v3():\n    '''\n    Create a function that counts down from 10 to 0, and for each number, it prints the number and\n    the number of seconds left (10 to 0 in 10 seconds).\n    This version uses the time module and a while loop.\n    '''\n\ndef count_down_from_10_v4():\n    '''\n    Create a function that counts down from 10 to 0, and for each number, it prints the number and\n    the number of seconds left (10 to 0 in 10 seconds).\n    This version uses the time module and a for loop.\n    '''\n\ndef count_down_from_10_v5():\n    '''\n    Create a function that counts down from 10 to 0, and for each number, it prints the number and\n    the number of seconds left (10 to 0 in 10 seconds).\n    This version uses the time module and a while loop.\n    The difference with v3 and v4 is that v5 uses range.\n    '''\n\ndef count_down_from_10_v6():\n    '''\n    Create a function that counts down from 10 to 0, and for each number, it prints the number and\n    the number of seconds left (10 to 0 in 10 seconds).\n    This version uses the time module and a for loop.\n    The difference with v5 is that it uses a list instead of range.\n    '''\n\ndef count_down_from_10_v7():\n    '''\n    Create a function that counts"}
