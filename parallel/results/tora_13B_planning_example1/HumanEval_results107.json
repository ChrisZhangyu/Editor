{"task_id": 107, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\n\ndef even_odd_palindrome(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd\n    integer palindromes that fall within the range(1, n), inclusive.\n\n    Example 1:\n\n        Input: 3\n        Output: (1, 2)\n        Explanation:\n        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3. one of them is even, and two of them are odd.\n\n    Example 2:\n\n        Input: 12\n        Output: (4, 6)\n        Explanation:\n        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11. four of them are even, and 6 of them are odd.\n\n    Note:\n        1. 1 <= n <= 10^3\n        2. returned tuple has the number of even and odd integer palindromes respectively.\n    \"\"\"\n    even_palindrome = 0\n    odd_palindrome = 0\n\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if str(i) == str(i)[::-1]:  # Check if number is a palindrome\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                even_palindrome += 1\n            else:\n                odd_palindrome += 1\n    return even_palindrome, odd_palindrome\n\n\n\ndef count_palindromes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a string, return the count of palindromes of even length and odd length.\n    A palindrome is a string that is the same forwards and backwards.\n\n    Example:\n        Input: \"aba\"\n        Output: (2, 1)\n        Explanation: \"a\" and \"b\" are of even length, and \"aba\" is of odd length.\n\n    Note:\n        Length of a palindrome is from 1 to 1000.\n    \"\"\"\n    even_palindrome = 0\n    odd_palindrome = 0\n\n    for i in range(1, 101):\n        for j in range(10**i, 10**(i+1):\n            if str(j) == str(j)[::-1]:  # Check if number is a palindrome\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    even_palindrome += 1\n                else:\n                    odd_palindrome += 1\n    return even_palindrome, odd_palindrome\n\n\n\ndef count_palindromes_in_string():\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a string, return the count of palindromes of even length and odd length.\n    A palindrome is a string that is the same forwards and backwards.\n\n    Example:\n        Input: \"aba\"\n        Output: (2, 1)\n        Explanation: \"a\" and \"b\" are of even length, and \"aba\" is of odd length.\n\n    Note:\n        Length of a palindrome is from 1 to 1000.\n    \"\"\"\n    even_pal"}
