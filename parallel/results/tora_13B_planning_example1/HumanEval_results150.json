{"task_id": 150, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\n\ndef x_or_y(n, x, y):\n    \"\"\"A simple program which should return the value of x if n is \n    a prime number and should return the value of y otherwise.\n\n    Examples:\n    for x_or_y(7, 34, 12) == 34\n    for x_or_y(15, 8, 5) == 5\n    \n    \"\"\"\n    # A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n    # A simple way to check if a number is prime is to see if it's divisible by 2 or 3.
