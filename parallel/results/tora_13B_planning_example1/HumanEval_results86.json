{"task_id": 86, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\n\ndef anti_shuffle(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.\n    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)\n    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in\n    ascending order based on ascii value.\n    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.\n\n    For example:\n    anti_shuffle('Hi') returns 'Hi'\n    anti_shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'\n    anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!') returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'\n    \"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    pass\n\ndef shuffle(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function that takes a string and returns an unordered version of it.\n    Unordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)\n    are replaced by a new word where all the characters are arranged in a random order.\n    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.\n\n    For example:\n    shuffle('Hi') returns 'Hi'\n    shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'\n    shuffle('Hello World!!!') returns 'Hlelo Wrdlo!'\n    \"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    pass\n\ndef reverse_words(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function that takes a string and returns a string where all the words\n    are reversed, but the order of the blank spaces are kept.\n    For example:\n    reverse_words('Hi') returns 'iH'\n    reverse_words('hello') returns 'olleh'\n    reverse_words('Hello World!!!') returns 'olleH !!!dlaW'\n    \"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    pass\n\ndef reverse_sentence(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function that takes a string and returns a string where all the words\n    are reversed, the order of the blank spaces are also reversed.\n    For example:\n    reverse_sentence('Hi') returns 'iH'\n    reverse_sentence('hello') returns 'olleh'\n    reverse_sentence('Hello World!!!') returns 'dlaW !!!olleH'\n    \"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    pass\n\ndef count_vowels(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function that takes a string and returns the count of vowels\n    For example:\n    count_vowels('Hi') returns 1\n    count_vowels('hello') returns 3\n    count_vowels('Hello World!!!') returns 3\n    \"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    pass\n\ndef count_consonants(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function that takes a string and returns the count of consonants\n    For example:\n    count_consonants('"}
