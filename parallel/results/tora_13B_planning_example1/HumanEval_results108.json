{"task_id": 108, "completion": "<s>\ndef encrypt(s):\n    '''\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being\n    rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    For example:\n    encrypt(\u2019hi\u2019) returns \u2019lm\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019asdfghjkl\u2019) returns \u2019ewhjklnop\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019gf\u2019) returns \u2019kj\u2019\n    encrypt(\u2019et\u2019) returns \u2019ix\u2019\n    Let\u2019s think step by step.\n    1. Create a alphabet, bias two places multiplied by two.\n    2. Loop the input, find the latter bias letter in alphabet.\n    3. Return result.\n    '''\n\n\ndef count_nums(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function count_nums which takes an array of integers and returns\n    the number of elements which has a sum of digits > 0.\n    If a number is negative, then its first signed digit will be negative:\n    e.g. -123 has signed digits -1, 2, and 3.\n    >>> count_nums([]) == 0\n    >>> count_nums([-1, 11, -11]) == 1\n    >>> count_nums([1, 1, 2]) == 3\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    for num in arr:\n        if sum(int(digit) for digit in str(num)) > 0:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\n\ndef count_nums_pythonic(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function count_nums which takes an array of integers and returns\n    the number of elements which has a sum of digits > 0.\n    If a number is negative, then its first signed digit will be negative:\n    e.g. -123 has signed digits -1, 2, and 3.\n    >>> count_nums([]) == 0\n    >>> count_nums([-1, 1, -1]) == 1\n    >>> count_nums([1, 1, 2]) == 3\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(1 for num in arr if sum(int(digit) for digit in str(num)) > 0)\n\n\ndef count_nums_pythonic_two(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function count_nums which takes an array of integers and returns\n    the number of elements which has a sum of digits > 0.\n    If a number is negative, then its first signed digit will be negative:\n    e.g. -123 has signed digits -1, 2, and 3.\n    >>> count_nums([]) == 0\n    >>> count_nums([-1, 1, -1]) == 1\n    >>> count_nums([1, 1, 2]) == 3\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(1 for num in arr if sum(int(digit) for digit in str(num) if int(digit) > 0) or int(digit) < 0)\n\n\ndef count_nums_pythonic_three(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function count_nums which takes an array of integers and returns\n    the number of elements which has a sum of digits > 0.\n    If a number is negative, then its first signed digit will be negative:\n    e.g. -123 has signed digits -1, 2, and 3.\n    >>> count_nums([]) == 0\n    >>> count_num"}
