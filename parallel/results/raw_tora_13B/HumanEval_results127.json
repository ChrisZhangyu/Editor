For example, interval = (start, end) = (1, 2).\n    The given intervals are closed which means that the interval (start, end)\n    includes both start and end.\n    For each given interval, it is assumed that its start is less or equal its end.\n    Your task is to determine whether the length of intersection of these two \n    intervals is a prime number.\n    Example, the intersection of the intervals (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3)\n    which its length is 1, which not a prime number.\n    If the length of the intersection is a prime number, return \"YES\",\n    otherwise, return \"NO\".\n    If the two intervals don't intersect, return \"NO\".\n\n\n    [input/output] samples:\n    intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) ==> \"NO\"\n    intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) ==> \"NO\"\n    intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)) ==> \"YES\"\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the intervals intersect\n    if interval1[1] >= interval2[0] and interval2[1] >= interval1[0]:\n        # Calculate the length of the intersection\n        length = min(interval1[1], interval2[1]) - max(interval1[0], interval2[0])\n        # Check if the length is a prime number\n        if is_prime(length):\n            return \"YES\"\n        else:\n            return \"NO\"\n    else:\n        return \"NO\"\n\n\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"A simple function to check if a number is prime\"\"\"\n    for i in range(2, n):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n\n\nresult = intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5))\nprint(result)\n```\n```output\nYES\n```\nThe length of the intersection of the intervals (-3, -1) and (-5, 5) is a prime number, so the answer is $\\boxed{YES}$.</s>"}
